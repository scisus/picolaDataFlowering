## blk228
**blk228 NA notes**
- p. 2, 3 (1997) *many blanks, but no '-'. Blanks are interspersed with data. Data entry very sparse starting on June 6. Perhaps not all clones checked those days?*
- p. 5, 6 (1998) *many blanks, but no '-'. Blanks are interspersed with data. Data entry very sparse starting on May 28. Perhaps not all clones checked those days?*
- p. 8, 9 (1997) *many blanks, but no '-'. Blanks are interspersed with data. Data entry very sparse starting on June 10. Perhaps not all clones checked those days?*
- p. 11, 12 (1998) *many blanks, but no '-'. Blanks are interspersed with data. Data entry very sparse on May 15 and June 1. Perhaps not all clones checked those days?*
- p. 30, 31 (2005) *Looks like only a couple entries May 30 (Clone 1581, 1466, 1560)*
- p. 33 (2006) SMP Late clones only June 7/06. *Looks like data only recorded for some clones on June 7 this year. Not seemingly random - marking blanks stops partway down the page and there is no June 7 entry at all on p. 34*
- p.36 (2007) *Big* "No SMP" *written across blank part of page. Looks like no data taken except on June 5 for this year/orchard*
- p. 42 (2009) *Blank spaces on June 4 with no notes to explain. Some have data, some not. On following page (43) data for all clones (including `-`. Given that almost all these clones are flowering, I do not think the clones with blanks were surveyed at all. Distribution on grid also suggests this.*
- p. 51 (2011) *Looks like only one day of data collected*

**Other blk288 notes**
- p. 16 (2000) legend has note for the confusing "Receptive Stage (Stages 5 or 6). It says "Receptive period: Stage 5&6 as per PL Pheno Manual." *I need to get a copy of this manual.*
- p. 24 (2003) Only one SMP June 8 for Late clones flagged. Late females flagged purple (1560, 1466, 1581, 1465). For 2004 add 2000 not flagged.
- p. 30 (2005) Average male crop ahead of [female]
- p. 31 (2005) Clone 1563 surveyed in CPF *Do I need to check for clones found in multiple orchards?*
- p. 31 (2005) Replaced 1466 Z-34 with EE-37
- p. 34 (2006) 20% open = 4. 80% closed = 5/ 20%open on North Side *legend notes*
- p. 39 (2008) has both the establishment year and graft year for most ramets
- p.48 (2010) Accidental entry? There's a Clone number (only two digits - 78) with no other associated data (X, Y, etc)
- p. 51 (2011) Clone 62 has no X or Y data, but phenology data for one date
- p. 51 (2011) 0 here means that there are NO female/male flowers period. Not that they are underdeveloped, but that they don't exist.

## cpf223
**cpf223 NA notes**
- p. 2, 4 (1999) *many blanks, but no '-'. Blanks are interspersed with data. Data entry very sparse starting June 21 and on June 1 and 3. Perhaps not all clones checked those days?*
- p. 22 (2005) *May 30 has only a few clones surveyed.*
- p. 46, 47 (2012) *Blanks all over the place, interspersed with `-`s. ASK ABOUT THIS*
